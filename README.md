This is a website in response to all of the "thoughts and prayers" sent out to the victims of the Stoneman Douglas High School mass shooting.
I, like many people, don't see thoughts and prayers as an excuse for action against the USA's gun problem.

Additional note: this site was thrown together rather quickly so I would not look too closely at the code as a good example
